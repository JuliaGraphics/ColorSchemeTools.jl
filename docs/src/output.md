# Saving colorschemes

## Saving colorschemes as images

Sometimes you want to save a colorscheme, which is usually just a pixel thick, as a swatch or image. You can do this with [`colorscheme_to_image()`](@ref).
The second argument is the number of rows.
The third argument is the number of times each pixel is repeated in the row.
The function returns an image which you can save using FileIO's `save()`:

```julia
using FileIO, ColorSchemeTools, Images, Colors

# 20 pixels for each color, 150 rows
img = colorscheme_to_image(ColorSchemes.vermeer, 150, 20)

save("/tmp/cs_vermeer-150-20.png", img)
```

!["vermeer swatch"](assets/figures/cs_vermeer-30-300.png)

The [`image_to_swatch()`](@ref) function (a shortcut) extracts a `n`-color scheme from a supplied image and saves it as a swatch in a PNG.

```julia
image_to_swatch("/tmp/input.png", 10, "/tmp/output.png")
```

## Saving colorschemes to text files

You can save a ColorScheme as a (Julia) text file with the imaginatively-titled [`colorscheme_to_text()`](@ref) function.

Remember to make the name a Julia-friendly one, because it may eventually become a symbol and a dictionary key if the Julia file is `include`-d.

```julia
colorscheme_to_text(ColorSchemes.vermeer,
        "the_lost_vermeer",           # name
        "/tmp/the_lost_vermeer.jl",   # filename
        category="dutch painters",    # category
        notes="it's not really lost"  # notes
        )
```

Of course, if you just want the color definitions, you can simply type:

```julia
map(println, ColorSchemes.vermeer.colors);
```
